Staying underwater for an extended period can lead to serious health risks, including drowning, hypothermia, and decompression sickness.\n\n**Steps to Take:**\n\n1. **Stay Calm:** Panicking can increase your oxygen consumption and make it harder to think clearly.\n2. **Ascend Slowly:** If possible, ascend gradually to avoid decompression sickness. Aim to rise at a rate of no more than 30 feet per minute (9 meters per minute).\n3. **Hold Your Breath:** If you can, hold your breath while ascending. This will help reduce the risk of nitrogen bubbles forming in your blood.\n4. **Exhale Gradually:** Once you reach the surface, exhale slowly to release any remaining air in your lungs.\n5. **Seek Medical Attention:** Even if you feel okay, it is important to seek medical attention after a near-drowning incident. You may have sustained internal injuries or other complications that require treatment.\n\n**Immediate Concerns:**\n\n* **Drowning:** If you are unable to resurface, you may be at risk of drowning. In this case, call for help immediately or try to use a flotation device to stay afloat.\n* **Hypothermia:** Prolonged immersion in cold water can lead to hypothermia, which can be life-threatening. Symptoms include shivering, numbness, and confusion.\n* **Decompression Sickness:** Ascending too quickly from underwater can cause nitrogen bubbles to form in your blood, leading to decompression sickness (also known as \"the bends\"). Symptoms include joint pain, fatigue, and difficulty breathing.\n\n**Preventive Measures:**\n\n* Always swim in supervised areas.\n* Avoid diving alone.\n* Get proper training and equipment for underwater activities.\n* Respect your limits and stay within your comfort zone.\n* Avoid drinking alcohol before or during water activities."
